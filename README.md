  ## User Story

  AS A developer <br>
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection <br>
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use <br>
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria

  GIVEN a text editor web application <br>
  WHEN I open my application in my editor <br>
  THEN I should see a client server folder structure <br>
  WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory <br>
  THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client <br>
  WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal <br>
  THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack <br>
  WHEN I run my webpack plugins <br>
  THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file <br>
  WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application <br>
  THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors <br>
  WHEN I open the text editor <br>
  THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage <br>
  WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window <br>
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB <br>
  WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it <br>
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB <br>
  WHEN I click on the Install button <br>
  THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop <br>
  WHEN I load my web application <br>
  THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox <br>
  WHEN I register a service worker <br>
  THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets <br>
  WHEN I deploy to Heroku <br>
